* Dynamically select the path size in lvlgen based on width and
  height.

* Different sized bodys... currently only 32x32.

* Inventory
  Probably need a bunch of code for displaying the inventory:
  - selecting items
  - scrolling?
  - viewing item descriptions?

* Stats, exp, etc.
  - very small number of stats... only ones that make sense

* Hold the key to get different jump heights.

* Hard-coded resource path gets in the way if you want to run mid from its
  subdir, or ever install itâ€¦  (Just need to add to the roots array).

* Random level generation

* Add enemies to level description?

* Improve visibisity somehow.
