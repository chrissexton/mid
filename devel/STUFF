* Use rectcontains in the inventory screen.

* Keep current level in memory.  Non-current levels stored on disk in
same format used by the lvlgen pipeline.

* Different sized bodies... currently only 32x32.

* Hard-coded resource path gets in the way if you want to run mid from
its subdir, or ever install itâ€¦  (Just need to add to the roots array).

* Add enemies to level description?

* Death. When you die, lose a random item and a stat point. 3 strikes
and you're permadead.

* Separate Tilecollide from some future flag Tilevisible.  This will
easily allow us to add things like grates or windows.

* Add small rooms with doors. lvlgen can add these rooms (marking entry
with 'd') and itmgen must make sure to add the keys.  Maybe doors could
be an env?

* Better lvlgen reachability.

* Try filling in the unreach blocks.  This will give us a well-defined
path throughout the level that we can then split with doors and secret
walls.

* Enemies drop equiptment.

* Swords stuck in a stone.  Different stats req. to pull them.
Different stone color for different stat requirement.

* Background things: torches, waterfalls, leaky drains, etc.

* Multiple doors.

* Lvlgen: water 'pours' out from one spot instead of being uniform.

* Set of water-only moves.  If cur path loc is in water, then try the
water only moves 1st then, if none can place, use normal moves.

* Different animations for different player body parts so that the anim
can reflect the equipt. on the given body part.

* Enemy AI:

	- dump just walk in one dir and fall.

	- platform aware:  trymove(), check fall flag, maybe turn around.

	- flying, swimming, etc.

	- player aware: move left if player is to left, else right.
