* Use rectcontains in the inventory screen.

* Keep current level in memory.  Non-current levels stored on disk in
same format used by the lvlgen pipeline.

* Different sized bodies... currently only 32x32.

* Hard-coded resource path gets in the way if you want to run mid from
its subdir, or ever install itâ€¦  (Just need to add to the roots array).

* Add enemies to level description?

* Death. When you die, lose a random item and a stat point. 3 strikes
and you're permadead.

* Separate Tilecollide from some future flag Tilevisible.  This will
easily allow us to add things like grates or windows.

* Add small rooms with doors. lvlgen can add these rooms (marking entry
with 'd') and itmgen must make sure to add the keys.  Maybe doors could
be an env?
