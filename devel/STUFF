* lvl.c: get most prominent level tile overlapping the given bbox.
  This way, the player will move slower in water and such.

* Different sized bodys... currently only 32x32.

* Inventory
  Probably need a bunch of code for displaying the inventory:
  - selecting items
  - scrolling?
  - viewing item descriptions?

* Stats, exp, etc.
  - very small number of stats... only ones that make sense

* Hard-coded resource path gets in the way if you want to run mid from its
  subdir, or ever install itâ€¦
