* lvl.c: fgtiles, bgtiles

* lvl.c: get most prominent level tile overlapping the given bbox.
  This way, the player will move slower in water and such.

* Enemies
  resource directory tree for each enemy:

  resrc/
  +- <enemy>/
     +- stand/
        +- anim
        +- 0.png
     +- walk/
     +- jump/

  This way each enemy is specified solely by <enemy> and the code
  should be able to find all of its animations from there.  Eventually
  we can put other data for the enemy in this directory if we want to.

* Should we merge some of the enemy code with player.c?  It seems like
  the player will share all of the resource structure and such.

* Inventory
  Probably need a bunch of code for displaying the inventory:
  - selecting items
  - scrolling?
  - viewing item descriptions?

* Stats, exp, etc.
  - very small number of stats... only ones that make sense

* Hard-coded resource path gets in the way if you want to run mid from its
  subdir, or ever install itâ€¦
